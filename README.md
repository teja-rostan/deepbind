# deepbind and expression learning with neural network

The assignment is in two parts. 

First part is in folder DEEPBIND (has a separate README file!).
The goal was to get binding scores of transcription factors on promoter 
sequences of an organism named Dictyostelium with a deepbind executable 
program (more in readme in DEEPBIND folder).
We concatenated expressions of a wildtype and several mutants that we
want to predict.

The second part includes predicting expressions with neural networks
(in Theano). It is available in a folder named NNET (with separate 
README). We still have quite several challenges to overcome.
